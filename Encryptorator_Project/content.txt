Helena checking in. I am a spy for the CIA. There are some unidentified foreign objects that have been sighted in Texas, and the farmers here refuse to report in fear of losing their land. I need backup ASAP so that we can go figure out what these objects are and who sent them. Contact detective
Bozeman for me and tell him he was right. I would appreciate it if you sent him here as well.

2 months since the last update, we have had many false alarms regarding UFO, all reports describing a similar shape and color. Starting to think that something may be going on. About to check a report in South Indiana.
